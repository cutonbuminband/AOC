The solutions to different the advent of code challenges for different years, in reverse chronological order. I haven't got round to solving all of them yet, but I hope to at some stage

Each year is structured as a single `org` file, with text and code blocks mixed together. The solution for each day looks for an input file located at `YEAR/data/DAY.txt`, with the exception of problems where the input is so short that it's hardcoded into the solutions file.
