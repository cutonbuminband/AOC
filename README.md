The solutions to different the advent of code challenges for different years.

Each year is structured as a single `org` file, with text and code blocks mixed together. The input files for each solution are read from the folder `/data/YEAR/`; the filename is usually just `DAY.txt`. There are some exceptions, and some problems where the input is so short that it's hardcoded into the solutions file.

Here's a table with my solutions for each year. The links take you to the rendered solution file for each year
